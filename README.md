 new file structure
This is a display of the websites I created with basic HTML and CSS

Projects:
	The Space Station
	
	Movie Theatre Site | Bootstrap
	
The Space Station:
	This was my first website intergrating css and I found it challenging at first but as I started to learn more about Classes and Attributes I quickly became excited to the visible transformations.
	The animation effects I felt were a needed structure of code during this prooject to make it come alive. I used a similar skeleton for the "One page Website" as well!
	Contains navbar/tables/css
	
Movie theatre | Bootstrap
	For me this website was cool and exciting to make because it felt like something I've actually seen before! The menu displays The different layouts used for this webpage was awesome to learn.
